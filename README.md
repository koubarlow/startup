[My Notes](notes.md)

Tomodachi is a journal-sharing app that connects a users from Japan with an users from the United States, and vice-versa. Users create deep relationships while allowing them to learn and practice Japanese, while gaining a deeper understanding of Japanese culture and life. Tomodachi also allows the same experience for users from Japan by helping them improve their English skills and learn what life outside of Japan is like.

## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [ ] Proper use of Markdown
- [ ] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [ ] Description of key features
- [ ] Description of how you will use each technology
- [ ] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever wanted to learn Japanese but don't know where to start? Or you want to improve your Japanese but are too busy? Or the conversations you've had on other language learning apps are shallow and go quiet quickly? Tomodachi solves those problems. Learn conversational Japanese by making friends from Japan through our journal-sharing feature. Our app will send you reminders so that you can spend 10 minutes or less if you're busy, or more time if you're free, to write journal entries and read journals from your friends.
